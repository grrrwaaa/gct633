<p>KAIST GSCT Fall 2013<br>Instructor: Dr. Graham Wakefield (<a href="http://www.grahamwakefield.net">grrrwaaa@gmail.com</a>)<br>Hours: Tue/Thu 14:30 - 16:00<br>Location: N25 3239<br>Language: English<br>Credit: 3<br>Web: <a href="http://grrrwaaa.github.com/gct633/">http://grrrwaaa.github.com/gct633/</a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>Theoretical issues, technical models, and exemplary works are presented in lecture sessions, and implemented during lab sessions. Toward the end of the course lab sessions will be oriented towards helping students with their final projects. Lecture and course materials, including the software engine, will be presented and disseminated through the class web-site.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of the course, students will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the many themes of audio and multimedia programming, how they have been applied in generative and interactive arts, and how it may be extrapolated into future culture technologies. </li>
<li>Be able to apply these techniques for tasks of problem-solving as well as interactive and creative works, as demonstrated in a project portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>The course is designed to be suitable to students with different levels of technical expertise, but prior programming experience is assumed.</p>
<h3>Assignments &amp; final project</h3>
<p>Assignments must be completed individually. Collaboration is permitted for final projects, however each student must be able to clearly identify which parts of the project they were responsible for. The final project may extend existing work from one (or more) of the assignments, but will be evaluated only according to the new contributions. </p>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<ul>
<li>The followings evaluation criteria may change: 
  A. Attendance:    10%<br>  B. Midterm exam:  10%<br>  C. Final exam:    10%<br>  D. Quiz:          0% <pre><code><span class="transposed_variable">E.</span> Report:        <span class="number">0</span><span class="comment">%    </span>
<span class="transposed_variable">F.</span> Assignments:   <span class="number">30</span><span class="comment">%    </span>
<span class="transposed_variable">G.</span> Project:       <span class="number">30</span><span class="comment">%    </span>
<span class="transposed_variable">H.</span> Presentation:  <span class="number">10</span><span class="comment">% </span></code></pre>
</li>
<li>Limitations on course retaking, if any: Some prior programming experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Materials</h3>
