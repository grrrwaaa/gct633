title: Multi-agent systems


# Multi-agent systems (agent-based models)

## What is an agent?

Sensors, actuators, internal processing (and storage), goals/motivations, metabolism/growth

## Random walks in nature

Distributed computing

Behavioral systems in cognitive science, AI & robotics

### Boids, flocking, swarms

### Vehicles

Reas' vehicles

### Neural networks

The neuron, von Neumann, biological & artificial plasticity, artificial neural networks (ANNs), supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning.

### Subsumption architecture

### Complex adaptive systems

### Game theory

## Agent-environment interaction

Chemotaxis

Ant colonies (stigmergy)

PSO
